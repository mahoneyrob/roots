Two algorithms for finding the roots of a number.  roots.py will get the square root, roots_2.py you can do fractional exponents to take different roots.  The method works by calling root().  It can take 3 parameters, only one is required.  The n value is the number in front of the root, so with a 2 it is a square root, 3 a cube root, etc...  The way I like to think about it is if we have root(x, y) then it is like evaluating x^(1/y).
